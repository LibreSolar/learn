# Introduction

Welcome to the Open Educational Resource (OER) for **Building DC Energy Systems**. Our aim is to describe most important aspects of DC energy systems including

- [Energy System Layout](/system/) to explain important general concepts,
- [Component Development](/development/) (e.g. charge controller electronics) and
- [Production](/production/) (e.g. for PCBs).

The development of this OER started in May 2019. It will be continuously improved and you can contribute directly [via GitHub](https://github.com/LibreSolar/learn.libre.solar/).

Some chapters of the OER are based on the previous [OER by Collective Open Source Hardware](http://cos-h.cc), which mainly focused on the reproduction of PCBs.

Hardware details will be explained based on the Open Source Hardware of the [Libre Solar project](https://libre.solar). However, this OER will describe the working principles and important aspects of DC energy systems independent of the actual hardware components used.

This OER is funded and supported by the [Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU)](https://www.hoou.de). Check out their website to find other interesting OERs and supporting information.
