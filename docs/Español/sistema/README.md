## Advantages of direct current (DC) systems

Most important components based of renewable energy systems like batteries and solar modules are based on direct current. The conversion to AC includes considerable amount of losses, especially for small systems for off-grid energy access. This is why this OER focuses mainly on DC energy system components and distribution grids.

## Component overview

The following picture gives an overview of power converters in a DC energy system:
